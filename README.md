# Dodge_Bullet_Rain

This project is a simple dodge game.
The main purpose is to survive as long as possible.

It was done for programming practice in Pygame, Python 3.11

All the assets were made by me using Paint3D
All the music except the "ouch" sound was made by me in beepbox: https://www.beepbox.co/
